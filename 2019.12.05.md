## Academics

### Holiday Vacations
* Vacation requests from Dec. 23rd through Jan. 6th will be approved, regardless of academic status. If Bocal is concerned about academic progress, you may be asked to come in for a meeting before you leave, but your vacation will be approved. 
* If you need a vacation longer than 21 days, contact Bocal (@IRIS)
* Send in your requests now on [portal.42.us.org](http://portal.42.us.org). Vacation is not automatic. A request needs to be sent before you leave.

 
### CYD Clarification & Updates
* PDF and FAQs have been updated 
* CYD correction is a two-step process. You are first corrected by your peers, and then assessed by Bocal. The peer grade is not your final CYD decision. 
* For example, "I got a 94 from peer review - does that mean I failed and I'm getting kicked out?" No. The case will be reviewed by Bocal.
* There should not be a situation where a cadet will be evicted out of the blue. Eviction is the very last step.
* If Bocal determines that you have failed CYD, we will contact you about next steps. There are several tiers of possible action.

### Contacting Bocal
* Don't be afraid to talk to Bocal and ask for help. Getting your questions answered may require making an appointment. Contact Bocal by messaging @IRIS on the new 42born2code slack.
* ask @IRIS for Bocal availability
* https://calendly.com/bocalians/meet-w-bocal
* Note: Bocal responses may be slower between Dec 23 - Jan 6

### Github Education Tools 
* Free stuff! Like domain names and cool tools
* Get access here: [portal.42.us.org/github](http://portal.42.us.org/github)
* You must be on 42 wifi to access the link and be logged into intra 
* If you can't access, pls msg @IRIS (the Bocal bot)

## Dormitory
### Don't Feed the Animals
* Do not feed the animals outside the dorms no matter how cute - there's been more poo, garbage, and mice in the last 2 months
* Doing this may spread disease/rabies and can get the school in trouble with the health department
* If you feed them, they will also start to depend on you and if you leave, kitties will starve :( 
* Best course is of action is to call animal shelter so that kitties can get proper care

### Security Issues
* Reminder to save security numbers. For emergencies call 911. For anything else, call Security.
* Lab #: +1 (408) 709-9275
* Dorm #: +1 (408) 202-3953

## Special Announcement
* Gaetan's goodbye - he is leaving 42 and his last day is Dec 13 :'(
* Gaetan - Let me tell you about why I am here and why I helped create 42. Back in 2013 in Paris, I had one of my first meetings with Xavier and he said "I want you to create a school that would be free for students... but you need to build a system that doesn't cost too much because we don't have unlimited resources. I believe we can educate the world"
* Keep in mind that Stanford has a $20 billion endowment to spend every year. 42 does not have that money.
* What costs a lot is teachers. So we set out to build a school without teachers and courses. Which is crazy. Everyone who comes to 42 is crazy. You make it happen by being here. 
* Thank you for your trust. To learn you don't need a teacher. It just depends on yourself. You can make it happen. It will be hard but you trust yourself.

## Live Questions 

### Q: 
Can cadets still use their wallet points to have lunch wtih Gaetan?

### A:
Gaetan/Meo - You have one week to buy lunch with Gaetan with your wallet points before he leaves on Dec 13. You can also choose to get coffee with him. 

---

### Q: 
Several tiers of action were mentioned in regards to CYD. Can you provide further clarification?
### A: 
Crystal - The tiers are still a work in progress however the current system has 5 tiers 
- Pass - 
- Pass with warning - there are some concerns about academic progress
- Meeting - Meet with bocal to get on track academically
- Last Chance - 
- Eviction - this is a difficult decision

Bocal understands that falling behind on academics happens sometimes - unfortunately the intra project doesn't support nuance at this time.

Bocal is trying to make it more clear that failing CYD doesn't automatically mean eviction. If you fail CYD, you will receive an email with details about next steps. If it's not clear, please come to us. Bocal does not want students to be in a position of not knowing what's going to happen with their housing.

### Q:
Question for Gaetan - Are you planning to do something as great as 42 afterwards? 

### A:
Gaetan - Yes, I have big hope for the world and for humanity. Today I want to sleep and rest. I think I want to become a surfer for a month and enjoy life before my next project in 2020.

---

### Q: 
It was mentioned in Slack that there will be a system to check for commits on projects. Can you provide more clarification?

### A: 
Meo - Vogsphere is important to learn how to navigate so it's important to make regular commits to Vogsphere, not just Github. 
* Starting next year, you will receive an email if you have not committed to an open vogsphere repo in a couple of weeks and will be prompted to make a commit before your account is closed due to inactivity. 
* Too many cadets have too many open projects that aren't being worked on. The purpose is to have cadets focused on the projects they are working on.

### Q: 
Is 42 Accelerate happening in January?

### A: 
Jin - Yes, expect a presentation from Jin discussing the details about 42 Accelerate at the beginning of 2020. Message @Jin_42SV (Jin Zheng) if you have questions.

---

### Q: 
Is Wifi in the dorms down? 

### A: 
Meo - No - it should be back up now. There was a minor small power outage today, but it is unsure what caused the power outage. Wifi technically is working in the dorms, but it is only consistent on the first floor. Wifi is intermittent on the 2nd and 3rd floor but we are aware of this issue. 

---

### Q: 
When is the Filemaker program happening next?
### A: 
Jamie - Filemaker happens on a Spring/Fall cycle. There are no finalized dates for Spring 2020 yet. 

---

### Q: 
Are there any plans for the new curriculum rollout?

### A: 
Not at present - it will be considered over the next few months however the current 42SV infrastructure doesn't support it. TBD. 

---

### Q: 
Is there any info about the new norm #DEFINE rules?
### A: 
Michael - The update to norm is to prevent people from macroing lines of code in your define. Use it for what it's meant for, not for obscuring additional lines of code.

---

### Q: 
Is anything being done about lab log hours being down and hours requirements for the dorms? 

### A: 
Crystal -
- For the past outage this week when internet was down, 6 hours were credited on both Sunday and Monday. 
- A few weeks ago when hours weren't logging, the hours requirement was taken down to 25 hours. 
- If there's a time when hours are down for a few hours, bocal meets to discuss how to remedy the situation. If hours are down for over a day, the weekly hours requirements are adjusted.
