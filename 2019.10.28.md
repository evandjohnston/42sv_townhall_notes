## Academics

### CYD Clarification

* Exams - at any given point, if we look at your profile, there should be two exams w/in the last 4 weeks
* Lvs - 1lv/month will for sure meet this criteria... but, sometimes it's hard and people fall behind, but are working... we see that and look at hours and project submissions, as well. we don't want to kick out people who are working
* Hours - 35hr/wk -- this is the minimum ... if you are getting your lv/month, 35hrs might be right for you. but, if you are falling behind, we are looking for more like \~50-60hrs/wk

### Vacation

* Vacations are for: 
	* Emergencies
	* Health issues (with Doctor’s note)
	* Students who are ahead in the curriculum
* Be specific in your request
* If your request is denied and it is urgent, please contact @Bocal as soon as possible
* How do vacations affect levels? 
	* They add a buffer according to time you are gone

### A:
There must be at least 35 eligible, active people in order to request a piscine. We've run piscines before with fewer, and a lot of people drop out. Piscines don't work with 5 people. Rally your friends, but only if they won't drop out halfway through the piscine.

### Q:
Is there a donation box to help and accelerate the repairs for the dorms?

_22 upvotes | 0 downvotes [Anonymous -- Oct 25, 2019, 7:46:37 PM]_
### A:
Bocal will not accept money from students toward repairs for the dorms. Now that we have a new exec director, bocal will be able to make some adjustments to how money is allocated.

---
### Q:
I know this has been brought up before. But can we please consider at night lowering the brightness of the lights to 75% at night in the lab? It seriously hurts my eyes sometimes and it's really unneeded imo. It's already extremely bright in the day.

_23 upvotes | 2 downvotes [Anonymous -- Oct 27, 2019, 1:57:27 AM]_
### A:
Manny will look into it. The problem right now is that it's automated in such a way that it tends to reset.

---
### Q:
Could you please provide us with the RV permission? Bay Area is expensive!!! Dorms overloaded.

_23 upvotes | 6 downvotes [Anonymous -- Oct 26, 2019, 6:37:22 PM]_
### A:
Bocal will work on figuring this out. This issue is under review, and if the situation changes bocal will give the community plenty of notification.

---
### Q:
New Holy Graph

_24 upvotes | 8 downvotes [Anonymous -- Oct 25, 2019, 4:48:43 PM]_
### A:
Local bocal can't give official info because it's not finalized yet. There are ways to look it up on intra >.>

---
### Q:
can you confirm that even though not all of these questions are answered in the town hall, that you are reading them and taking them into consideration?

_17 upvotes | 2 downvotes [Anonymous -- Oct 27, 2019, 2:35:55 AM]_
### A:
Yes. Bocal also reads event feedbacks, and decides which companies to invite back based on them. :)

---
### Q:
Hello everyone.
Dont you think its better to change all staff in bocal periodically? (like every 4-6 month)
It seems people there got a power and can do whatever they want instead of develop and make this place better for everyone.

_16 upvotes | 1 downvotes [Anonymous Oct 28, 2019, 12:46 PM]_
### A:
Jamie: "Why are you coming at us like this instead of coming and having a personal conversation with us? If you have an issue with someone, come talk to us so we can fix it. This feedback is valuable, but it's not concrete. As we restructure with our new exec director, we may be changing some things."

---
### Q:
we should get \~12 sick days / year that work like vacation days except they apply automatically instead of being bocal approved (in case we get sick, need a mental health day, need to go to the doctor, or any other emergency!!)

_18 upvotes | 4 downvotes [Anonymous -- Oct 27, 2019, 1:36:16 AM]_
### A:
Local bocal will bring this up with Paris. :)

### Q:
Crystal, we appreciate how communicative you are with us cadets!
Great choice for a bocalean.

### Discussion on the interaction between burnout, dorm requirements, and housing insecurity

agrodzin: "Burnout is an issue that everyone should be aware of. 50-60 hours logged per week is a lot and I think we need to keep in mind that it can lead to burnout."

mbrave: "Vacation hours are only for people who are ahead of the curriculum... but that's only like 20 people. Doesn't that tend to increase burnout?"

Gaetan: "Burnout happens to all of us during our lives. You need to recognize it in yourself and manage yourself. In this school, you may experience burnout, and you will also hopefully learn how to manage it so that you know how when you enter the workforce. I built day09 of the piscine to trap people into trying to stay up 24-hours straight so they fall asleep during the exam and learn about burnout. If you can't spend 35 hours per week here, maybe it's not the school for you"

Dan: "What's the goal here? This is a school for programmers. Your goal is to get a programming job. For that job, you will compete with people who spent 4+ years learning how to be a programmer. You cannot compete with these people if you spend only 35 hours per week for a year."

japarbs: "The CYD requirements are not statistically backed; very few people meet those requirements; they're vague."

Gaetan: "CYD requirements are clear. We talk about them every town hall."

mmoros: "Different people are behind by different amounts. If no one is meeting the official requirements, it's good that bocal is willing to work with people, but no one knows where they stand with respect to getting kicked out of their house. That's why the actual requirements are vague."

Michael: "There are basically two categories of students who fall onto CYD: students below level 7 who aren't progressing, and students above level 7 who just aren't turning in projects"

Stephen: "Look at the people who are passing CYD. Look how many hours they're spending in the lab, and how many of those hours they're actively working. It's hard to push yourself like that, but these are the people who know what they're up against."

Crystal: "It's scary to feel like you're behind on a number that determines your housing status. I know how scary it is to feel like there's a wolf chasing you. If you start feeling like you're falling behind, come talk to us. If you feel afraid to talk to us, I consider that a personal failing."

### Q:
Situation in the dorm
1. Too many people per room. We have only 200 sq feet of living space, it is not enough even for 3 people by the Housing Maintenance code. 
2. Fans in bathrooms don't work. It is always wet, smells bad and we have mold.
3. Almost everyone cooks in the dorm - against the rules.

i think CYD hours should be 70 every 2 weeks instead of 35 every week. just in case someone runs out of time and cares about making up their hours the next week

### Q:
A cadet care pantry for those who are unable to afford basic necessities supplies. I've met a few cadets living on 100-150$/month, and I'm shocked they're able to survive (eg. eating ramen daily). The cadet care pantry would be free for those who want to pick up something from there.

Why are the bathrooms so under maintained? I know we have janitors / cleaning staff. The entire downstairs is almost non functional. Paper towels are often missing and sometimes just a roll above (That's extremely lazy and insanitary). The wall mounted soap never refilled. Why is this?
